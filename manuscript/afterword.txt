# Afterword

I hope that you've enjoyed reading this book, and that you've either learnt
something or been inspired to try out some of the new features available in
KitKat. Although the adoption rates of KitKat aren't as high as developers might
like, that doesn't mean that it's not worth putting in some effort to discover
what new opportunities are available, and to think about the ways we can use them
to improve our existing apps. 

This book looked at 6 of the headline new features introduced in KitKat, but there
were a few others. If you're interested in reading more, then the best place to
start is the official documentation, which gives details of the new features.

If you have any feedback about the book or its content then I'd love to hear it -

## Useful Links

I've compiled a few useful links of interest, for further reading:

- [shinobicontrols.com](http://www.shinobicontrols.com/) Creators of the finest
UI controls for Android (and iOS). Made this book possible - you should check them
out - they're amazing.
- [developer.android.com](http://developer.android.com/) It's a fairly obvious
link, but there's loads of good stuff on here. The docs are pretty good, so if you
want to find out more info about any of the things you've read about in the book,
then this is the place to start.
- [Android Development on G+](https://plus.google.com/communities/105153134372062985968)
An incredibly active resource for discovering what's happening in the world of
Android.
- [genymotion.com](http://www.genymotion.com/) An incredibly fast Android emulator.
Without this, Android development is painful - highly recommended.
