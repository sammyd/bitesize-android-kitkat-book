## Audience



## Book layout

This book is a collection of weekly blog posts, which on the most-part stand
alone. There are one or two which cross-reference each other, but they can
be read entirely independently.

The chapters aren't meant to be complete tutorials, and as such, the code snippets
within each chapter usually just highlight the more salient bits of code associated
with a particular step. However, each chapter has an accompanying working app, the
source code for which can be found on GitHub.

## Source code

The GitHub repository at 
[github.com/ShinobiControls/bitesize-kitkat](https://github.com/ShinobiControls/bitesize-kitkat)
contains projects which accompany each chapter.

The projects are all built using Android Studio 0.4.4, and should run straight
after downloading. Any pull-requests for fixes and improvements will be greatly
appreciated!
