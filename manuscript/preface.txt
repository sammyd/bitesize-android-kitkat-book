Welcome to Bitesize Android KitKat! In November 2013, Google released the 19th
revision of the Android API - creating Android 4.4 - better known as KitKat.
Although only a dot-release, there were still plenty of interesting new APIs and
frameworks to get developers and users excited. This book takes a detailed look
at six of the most important of these.

Every single chapter is based around a sample app, which is used to demonstrate
the framework or new feature in question. This allows you, the reader, to not only
follow along with a detailed description of how to use the feature in question,
but also to see some sample code of it in action.

If you have any comments or corrections then please do let me know - I'm

## Audience

This book is not for beginners. It expects a familiarity with developing for the
Android operating system, since it is taking a detailed look at features which are
new to Android KitKat. All of the projects herein were developed using Android
Studio, which at the time of writing is still pre-release software. You should
be able to follow along with either Android Studio, or a different environment of
your choosing.

If you are just starting out as an Android developer, then I suggest that you go
and run through some getting-started tutorials, and then return to this book once
you feel comfortable with the basics.


## Book layout

This book is a collection of weekly blog posts, which on the most-part stand
alone. There are one or two which cross-reference each other, but they can
be read entirely independently.

The chapters aren't meant to be complete tutorials, and as such, the code snippets
within each chapter usually just highlight the more salient bits of code associated
with a particular step. However, each chapter has an accompanying working app, the
source code for which can be found on GitHub.

## Source code

The GitHub repository at 
[github.com/ShinobiControls/bitesize-kitkat](https://github.com/ShinobiControls/bitesize-kitkat)
contains projects which accompany each chapter.

The projects are all built using Android Studio 0.4.4, and should run straight
after downloading. Any pull-requests for fixes and improvements will be greatly
appreciated!
